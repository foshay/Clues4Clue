## Things of note
There are **9** potential Rooms.
There are **6** potential Characters.
There are **6** potential Weapons.

All of the potential characters must be on the board.

After 1 Room Card, 1 Character Card, and 1 Weapon Card have been placed in the 'Case file' envelope. Then, the cards are shuffled together (Rooms, Characters, and Weapons) and dealt clockwise around the table (Some players can receive more cards than others). Due to the tendancy of players who are shuffling to pick the person next to them, or themselves to start dealing, you should sit to the left of the dealer. 

After 'stocking' the case file there will be a total of (9+6+6-3) cards available (18) in this case.

8 R
5 C
5 W

With 6 people playing, each player will receive 3 cards exactly. You are more likely to get a room card (60% more likely)
With 5 players, 3 players will receive an extra card.
With 4 players, 2 players will receive an extra card.
This can be written as a relationship of the form (Total Cards)%(Number of Players)

During the play of the game each player rolls 2 dice to advance their characters around the board. Once their character enters a room, they can make a "**Suggestion**". By doing this they move the weapon AND the character to that room (This includes player characters)

To win the game you must make an accusation. This is the same as a Suggestion except you do not have to be in the room. If you are wrong about your accusation, you are out of the game and can only show players your cards to disprove their suggestions.
